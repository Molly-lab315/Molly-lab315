Some projects I'm particularly proud of:
- Streamlit projects I've been working:
    - The streamlit-book library ([ReadTheDocs](https://share.streamlit.io/sebastiandres/streamlit_datasaurus/main/app.py) - [Demo](https://share.streamlit.io/sebastiandres/stb_book_demo_v070/main) - [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-book/)):  provide tools to create interactive multipaged apps on streamlit apps using python/markdown and simple folder convention.
    - Machine Learning Education ([website](https://streamlit-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): Short & fun interactive pages for some Machine Learning concepts, made with Streamlit. An explanation of the [confusion matrix](https://share.streamlit.io/Molly-lab315//ml-edu-1-confusion-matrix/main) (with the matrix movie theme) and the mythical [datasaurus](https://share.streamlit.io/Molly-lab315//streamlit_datasaurus/main/app.py) (the incredible dataset).
    - Happy Birds ([app](https://share.streamlit.io/Molly-lab315//streamlit_happy_birds/main/happy_birds.py)): a small app created to showcase streamlit_book capabilities and featured on [streamlit's blog](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-create-interactive-books-with-streamlit-and-streamlit-book-in-5-steps/).
- [linktree emulator](https://github.com/Molly-lab315//linktree): The smallest emulator for linktree site. Presents the jupyter notebook in several formats (interactive with binder, html, pdf, videos, etc). Navigate my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/Molly-lab315/) to understand.
- [ppt to rise](https://github.com/Molly-lab315//pptx_to_RISE): Helps to convert a powerpoint presentation to jupyter notebook + RISE.
- [pypsdier](https://github.com/Molly-lab315//pypsdier): a python library to solve pde reaction-difussion equations, considering inmmobilized catalyst particles. 
- [polite](https://github.com/Molly-lab315/polite): littlest survey website.
